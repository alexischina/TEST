Background research on dog waste, market research on existing products, and user research on potential stakeholders was conducted to develop a system of dog waste pickup that takes into consideration environmental factors and human convenience and practicality. Several rounds of ideation were completed to explore different methods of dog waste pick up and disposal. Ideas with the most potential were explored further until a direction was chosen. The decided solution was a physical waste bin tied in with a smart phone application. Model-making proceeded for the waste bin, while wireframes were developed for the application. Plan PickUp disposal bins can be placed in a variety of environments to offer dog owners an environmentally friendly method of waste disposal. These bins are emptied and taken to dog waste-specific compost centers, which have the capabilities of disposing of dog waste without harming humans or the environment. The corresponding smart phone application allows users to gain points, rankings, and rewards for utilizing Plan PickUp. When a user disposes of their dog waste, they scan the Plan PickUp disposal bin with their smartphone, earning points. They then can exchange points earned for rewards and see how they match up with other Plan PickUp users in the area. ",
